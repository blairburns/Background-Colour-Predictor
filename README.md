# Background Colour Predictor

### About

This was a project completed for a school subject. My first attempt at writing a neural network using the Tensorflow library. This model predicts the optimal background colour (Black or White) when given RGB coloured text.

## Install

Create virtual environment
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python3 env
```

Activate the virtual environment
```
cd env
source ./bin/activate
```

Install Tensorflow in the virtual environment
```
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```

To deactivate the virtual environment

`(env)$ deactivate`


## Run

`(env)$ python3 app.py`

### Issues

Due to the program being buggy, don't except it to work straight out of the box
